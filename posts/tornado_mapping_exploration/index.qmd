### What state usually have the most tornadoes?

It looks like Texas has had the most tornadoes over the years

```{r}
most_tornadoes <- tornado |>
  select(st,ns) |>
  group_by(st) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  top_n(10)

most_tornadoes |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(st, -n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#d16002") +
  labs(
    title = "States with the most tornadoes over the years",
    x = "states in abbreviations",
    y = "number of tornadoes"
  ) +
  theme_dark()
```

#### But i want to see which state has had the most tornadoes in the past 5 years?

Texas is in the top 10 in 3 of the past 5 years Texas has the most in 2019,2022 and 2020.

```{r}
past5 <- tornado |>
  select(st,ns,yr) |>
  filter(yr %in% c("2018","2019","2020","2021","2022"), st %in% c("TX","OK","IA","MS","AL")) |> 
  group_by(st,yr) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

past5 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = yr, color = st)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Most Tornadoes In The Past 5 Years",
    subtitle = "Showing the Unpredictability of Tornadoes",
    x = "Number of Tornadoes",
    y = "year"
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r}
past5 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = st, y = n, color = yr)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
past5 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = st,y = n, fill = yr)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Tornadoes over The Past 5 Years",
    subtitle = "showing the impact more clearly",
    x = "states",
    y = "Number of Tornadoes"
  )
```

### What was the most dangerous tornado in the U.S between 1950-2022?

The tornado that was the most dangerous from 1950 to 2022 was the tornado in 2011 that happened in Missouri there were 158 fatalities the tornado was called Joplin.

```{r}
tornado |>
  select(st,mag,yr,fat) |>
  filter(mag %in% "5",) |>
  group_by(fat) |>
  arrange(desc(fat))
```
